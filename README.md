# 🚀 FAANG-Level DSA Pattern Mastery System

> Structured thinking beats random grinding.

Welcome to a pattern-focused Data Structures & Algorithms system built for serious technical interview preparation.

This repository is not a random collection of problems.  
It is a structured roadmap covering the most important patterns tested in FAANG-level interviews.

# 🗺 Mastery Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundations (Weeks 1–3)
Build complexity awareness and brute-force elimination reflex.

### Phase 2 — Structural Discipline (Weeks 4–6)
Control invariants, pointers, and order maintenance.

### Phase 3 — Graph & Tree Maturity (Weeks 7–10)
Model problems as systems of relationships.

### Phase 4 — DP Abstraction (Weeks 11–14)
Define state → derive transition → optimize.

# 🛠 How to Use This Repo

For each problem:

1. Attempt without hints
2. Write brute-force solution
3. Optimize logically
4. Analyze complexity
5. Re-solve after 2–3 weeks

Track:
- Mistakes
- Recognition time
- Clean implementation

Repetition builds instinct.
